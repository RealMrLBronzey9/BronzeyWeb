    <h1>My Paragraph of Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        This is a paragraph of thoughts that I am currently having as I am typing this. The date is August 26 2024 just so you know. Fortnite is a weird game with weird lore like its amazing how its canon that Batman, Kratos, Thor, Ariana Grande, Naruto, and other characters can exist in the same lore. Also my favourite game series might have to be the Touhou series. Love the bullet hell gameplay and also the characters are cool as well and also great OST. Probably my favourite Touhou game has to be Imperishable Night (Touhou 8), it just excels at everything like the OST is really good here I can't think of any real mediocre ones, gameplay especially is good like the human-youkai meter and the time mechanic it makes me strategize or at least think on how I should shoot and when to shift, story is pretty good as well, but my favourite has to be the bullet patterns like they are actually really good especially during Marisa's boss fight in stage 4 when you play as either the border team or the scarlet team. Another favourite Touhou game I like is Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom (Touhou 15) very difficult game throughout even stage 1 was pretty difficult. For Touhou games I only have played up to 15 and currently I don't have much plan to play any of the games past that for now. Kinda want to 1cc some of the games first maybe a lunatic 1cc in EoSD or PCB. Touhou also has a large influence on a lot of stuff and its pretty hidden too. Did you know that the Empress of Light boss in Terraria is inspired by these games? Or that in the Geometry Dash extreme demon level "Yatagarusu" the music for that level is a remix of the final boss oof Touhou 11? The Bad Apple!! video is also Touhou. Undertale is also partly inspired by Touhou. Heck even League of Legends have references. LITERALLY SEARCHED THIS UP EVEN CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS COLD WAR HAS TOUHOU REFERENCE WHAT  Though I do kinda hope that Touhou doesn't become too mainstream though. Anyways enough Touhou I think that is good enough for this paragraph. So I guess Minecraft then. I think my favourite thing to do in Minecraft is exploring and raiding structures. Its just fun. Ok I am getting tired of writing and I actually do want to push an update to the website so yeah.
